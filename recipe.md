first, use a nonstick pan or spread butter/oil on the pan.
put the pan on the stove and set the stove to high.
once the pan is heated up, crack two eggs on the pan.
set the stove to medium after the omelet starts to form and sprinkle salt and/or pepper if wanted.
gently lift the edge of the omelet to check if one side is done.
if one side is done, use a spatula to flip the omelet.
after letting the omelet sit for a couple of minutes, check to see if the other side is done.
if both sides are well cooked, pick up the omelet with a spatula and transfer it to a plate.
let the omelet cool down, and after it is cooled down, bon appetit!
